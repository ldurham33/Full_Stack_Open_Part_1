# Full_Stack_Open_Part_1
I am working on the FullStackOpen course and these are the necessary exercises for part 1. One displays certain course information in react.
One has buttons to give good, bad or neutral feedback, and displays statistics about them.
The last one shuffles through a list of quotes randomly upon a button click, and allows the user to vote on their favorite. It keeps track of the votes and always displays the top quote.
